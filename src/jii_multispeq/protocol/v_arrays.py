"""
MultispeQ protocols can contain a so called ``v_arrays`` that allow to define 
values as variabls, which can be used throughout the protocol, so the value
itself doesn't need to be repeated multiple times throughout the protocol.
The functions allow to access the ``v_arrays`` themselfs as well as
accessing specific variable values, so they can be available for the later
data analysis.
